# AHP_HELPER_BOT!

Welcome to my new repository for a simple little
Python package that will help anyone make a helpful,
fun Twitch bot! The bot you make with this package will
allow you to make simple commands to interface with
other popular bots like Nightbot, as well as leverage
the power of Python (and the tons of existing libraries)
to make your own cool features. Another useful feature
is the ability to modify/store variables and change
files on your system that can be used to alter your
stream layout directly from your own Twitch chat.

### Prereqs

* Python 3
* A Twitch account for your bot
